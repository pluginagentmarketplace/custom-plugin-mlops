## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't**: Watch tutorials without coding along
✅ **Do**: Code along in real-time, modify examples

❌ **Don't**: Skip the fundamentals to rush to advanced topics
✅ **Do**: Master foundations before moving forward

❌ **Don't**: Learn in isolation without projects
✅ **Do**: Build projects every week, apply learning

❌ **Don't**: Memorize, try to understand
✅ **Do**: Read code, ask why, experiment

❌ **Don't**: Stick with one resource for months
✅ **Do**: Mix sources (video, written, interactive) for different perspectives
