## Essential Skills Matrix

| Platform | Language | Primary Framework | Learning Curve |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | Kotlin | Jetpack | Moderate-High |
| iOS | Swift | SwiftUI/UIKit | Moderate |
| Cross-Platform | JavaScript | React Native | Moderate |
| Cross-Platform | Dart | Flutter | Moderate |

## Recommended Learning Sequence

**Option 1: Native Development**
1. Choose Android (Kotlin) or iOS (Swift)
2. Master fundamentals (3-6 months)
3. Advanced patterns and deployment (6-12 months)

**Option 2: Cross-Platform First**
1. Start with React Native or Flutter
2. Build for both platforms simultaneously
3. Optional: Learn native development later

**Option 3: Full Mobile Mastery**
1. Native Android (Kotlin) - 3-6 months
2. Native iOS (Swift) - 3-6 months
3. Cross-platform (React Native or Flutter) - 3-6 months

## Tools & Environment

- **Android**: Android Studio, Gradle, Logcat, Emulator
- **iOS**: Xcode, Swift Package Manager, iOS Simulator
- **React Native**: VS Code, Expo CLI, Metro Bundler
- **Flutter**: VS Code/Android Studio, Flutter CLI, DevTools
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **Testing**: JUnit/Espresso (Android), XCTest (iOS), Jest (React Native), Mockito (Flutter)

## Hands-on Projects

1. **Phase 1**: Simple todo app with local storage
2. **Phase 2**: Weather app with API integration
3. **Phase 3**: Social media app with authentication
4. **Phase 4**: Cross-platform app for both platforms

## Next Steps

1. **Use `/learn`** to choose your mobile platform
2. **Use `/browse-agent`** to explore all mobile paths
3. **Use `/assess`** to evaluate mobile development skills
4. **Use `/projects`** to find mobile development projects
